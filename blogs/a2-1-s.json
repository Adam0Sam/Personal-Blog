    "content": "Organizing the auction house for our school’s ‘Hundred Days’ event holds special importance, especially for our fourth graders. This event isn’t just about fundraising; it’s about teaching financial literacy and responsibility. Through using their 'licdolers' to bid on items, students learn the value of money and decision-making.Beyond financial lessons, the event celebrates our community’s spirit and unity. It’s a time for students, parents, and faculty to come together and support one another. For fourth graders, it’s a chance to celebrate their achievements and have fun with their classmates, making memories that last a lifetime.",
