While I’m no stranger to web development, this is my first foray into writing extensive backend code—a challenge I wholeheartedly embrace.The ‘Hundred Days’ event isn’t just about frontend aesthetics or fundraising efforts; it’s about leveraging technology to enhance the experience for our school community. With NodeJS, I have the opportunity to craft a robust backend infrastructure that powers seamless interactions and data management for the event.Navigating the intricacies of NodeJS is a learning curve, but it’s a welcome challenge that pushes me to expand my skill set. From setting up APIs to handling database queries, every line of code I write brings me closer to realizing the vision of a dynamic and responsive event platform.As I tackle this new frontier in backend development, I’m reminded of the importance of pushing boundaries and embracing growth. The ‘Hundred Days’ event serves as a catalyst for innovation and creativity, and by building the backend with NodeJS, I’m contributing to its success in a meaningful way.",
