    "content": "Acting in the ‘Hundred Days’ play was just one of my many responsibilities during this important event. Beyond my role on stage, I ensured the auction house ran smoothly, managed the bar setup, and kept the simtadienis app I built functional. It was a whirlwind of activity, requiring constant attention and multitasking.The auction house and bar operations went off without a hitch. The auction was lively, and the bar efficiently served everyone, adding to the festive atmosphere. The real challenge, however, came with the simtadienis app. Despite thorough testing, the app faced unexpected issues. Some ninth graders attempted a DDoS attack, overwhelming the system and causing it to crash under heavy load.Despite this setback, the event was a success. The technical hiccups didn't dampen the spirits of the participants or the organizers. We all adapted quickly, ensuring the overall experience remained enjoyable.In the end, the ‘Hundred Days’ event was a blend of challenges and triumphs. It highlighted the importance of flexibility and teamwork. Even with the app issues, the event was memorable, showcasing our ability to create a fun and engaging experience for everyone involved.",
