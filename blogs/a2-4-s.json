    "content": "As we rehearse for the ‘Hundred Days’ play, the excitement in the air is palpable. For many of us, myself included, acting isn’t a regular occurrence. Yet, this opportunity to participate in the play is not just about stepping into a new role on stage; it’s about exploring a fresh avenue of self-expression.The ‘Hundred Days’ event isn’t just about fundraising or celebrating milestones; it’s about embracing creativity and camaraderie. As we dive into our roles, we’re not just memorizing lines; we’re immersing ourselves in a shared experience that transcends the stage. For me, this is a chance to step outside my comfort zone and discover new facets of my identity.While acting may be unfamiliar territory, it’s a medium through which I can channel my creativity and emotions in ways I haven’t before. Whether portraying a character or delivering lines, every moment on stage is an opportunity to connect with the audience and share a piece of myself.",
